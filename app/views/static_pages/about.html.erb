                <h2>About SUTD Mountaineering</h2>
                <p>We started off in May 2012, when the pioneer batch of students matriculated. As pioneers of SUTD, we wanted to do something for the school and something we really loved. We gathered a group of individuals interested in mountaineering and founded SUTD Mountaineering. We began generating ideas on what we could do.</p>
                <p>Our initial idea was Mount Everest, but that proved to be very challenging and dangerous, as we had limited time. That idea was rejected, but we remained optimistic and began generating new ideas. Our new ideas were also rejected, and there wasnâ€™t much progress.</p>
                <p>We tried our very best to keep the vision alive. Our perseverance paid off and we finally got an idea approved: To name a mountain after SUTD. We began raising funds and spreading awareness of what we were doing and we managed to raise funds for our club and other 5th Rows in SUTD.</p>
                <p>Since then, we have organized trips to regional mountains like Mount Rinjani, Indonesia, and Xue Shan, Taiwan. We are constantly seeking new adventures, so join us!</p>
                <p>In any case, the picture on the left wasn't from us. It was done by a professional photographer who shot for <a href="http://wearesutd.sutd.edu.sg">wearesutd</a>. Do check that out!</p>
